## üìã Project Description

This project demonstrates autonomous navigation using the TurtleBot3 robot platform with ROS2 and Navigation2 (Nav2). It provides a complete setup for simulating and testing navigation capabilities, including SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), path planning, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous navigation in various environments.

The TurtleBot3 is a small, affordable, programmable, ROS-based mobile robot for education, research, and product development. This project leverages its capabilities combined with the powerful Nav2 stack to implement robust navigation solutions.

## üß≠ Navigation2 (Nav2)

Navigation2 is the next generation ROS navigation stack designed specifically for ROS2. It provides a set of modules for robot navigation, including:

- üó∫Ô∏è Map building and localization
- üõ£Ô∏è Path planning and following
- üöß Obstacle avoidance
- üîÑ Recovery behaviors

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- ROS2 (Foxy, Galactic, or Humble)
- Gazebo simulation environment
- TurtleBot3 packages

### Step 1: Setup Environment

```bash
# Set TurtleBot3 model (choose one: burger, waffle, waffle_pi)
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/humble/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models
```

### Step 2: Launch Simulation Environment

```bash
# Launch Gazebo with a world map
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```

### Step 3: Start Navigation2

```bash
# Launch Nav2 with a pre-built map
ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py use_sim_time:=True map:=/path/to/your/map.yaml
```

### Step 4: Set Navigation Goal

- In RViz, click on the "2D Pose Estimate" button and set the initial pose of the robot
- Click on the "2D Goal Pose" button and set a navigation goal
- The robot will autonomously plan a path and navigate to the goal while avoiding obstacles

### Step 5: SLAM Mapping (Optional)

If you need to create a new map:

```bash
# Launch SLAM toolbox
ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=True
# Save map when complete
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/map
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

- **Localization Accuracy**: Typically within 5cm in simulation
- **Path Planning**: Optimal paths with dynamic obstacle avoidance
- **Navigation Speed**: Configurable based on safety requirements
